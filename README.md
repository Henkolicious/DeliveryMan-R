### Info

<p>
(1) a list of two matrices giving the traffice conditions. The first matrix is named 'hroads' and gives a matrix of traffice conditions on the horizontal roads. The second matrix is named 'vroads' and gives a matrix of traffic conditional on the vertical roads. <1,1> is the bottom left, and <dim,dim> is the top right. 

(2) a list providing information about your car. This list includes the x and y coordinates of the car with names 'x' and 'y', the package the car is carrying, with name 'load' (this is 0 if no package is being carried), a list called 'mem' that you can use to store information you want to remember from turn to turn, and a field called nextMove where you will write what you want the car to do. Moves are specified as on the number-pad (2 down, 4 left, 6 right, 8 up, 5 stay still). 

(3) A matrix containing information about the packages. This contains five columns and a row for each package. The first two columns give x and y coordinates about where the package should be picked up from. The next two columns give x and y coordinates about where the package should be delivered to. The final column specifies the package status (0 is not picked up, 1 is picked up but not delivered, 2 is delivered). Your function should return the car object with the nextMove specified.
